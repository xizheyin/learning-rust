## Why This Book?

Many people find Rust difficult to learn. The first reaction is often "the syntax is weird" or "ownership and lifetimes are too abstract." In reality, **most people struggle with Rust not because the language itself is too hard, but because they lack fundamental computer science knowledge**.

In real teaching and corporate training, we found:
- Many students have learned C, but are not solid in fundamentals like memory, processes, threads, file systems, or compilation principles.
- When they encounter Rust's ownership, borrowing, or concurrency safety, they feel lost—not because Rust is strange, but because their foundations are weak.
- Many of Rust's "difficulties" are actually common to modern systems programming; Rust just forces you to face them directly.

**The biggest feature of this book is that it weaves computer science fundamentals—your "internal strength"—throughout the process of learning Rust.**

You'll not only learn Rust syntax and engineering practice, but also systematically review computer architecture, memory management, operating systems, concurrency, and other core topics.
Many Rust design points are explained by comparing with other languages (especially C/C++) and underlying principles, helping you build "migration thinking."
With this approach, you won't just write high-quality Rust code—you'll build a solid foundation for any future systems development.

## Why Build Your "Internal Strength" in the AI Era?

You might ask: with AI tools so powerful now, and code being auto-generated, why bother with fundamentals and low-level knowledge?

**The answer is simple: AI can help you write code, but only if you understand the underlying principles can you write truly high-quality, controllable, and secure systems.**

AI can generate functions and complete syntax, but when it comes to complex system design, performance tuning, concurrency safety, or deep bugs, only those with strong fundamentals can understand, optimize, and control the big picture.
If you only "copy code from AI," you'll struggle to spot or fix hidden risks, performance bottlenecks, or architectural flaws in AI-generated code.
In the future, AI will be a great assistant for developers, but **only those with solid foundations and deep understanding can master AI tools—instead of being limited by them**.

**So, the AI era makes fundamentals even more important.**
You'll find that the stronger your core skills, the more you can use AI for efficient development and creative system design.
This book aims to help you "cultivate both inside and out," so you remain irreplaceable—even in the age of AI.

**Who is this book for?**
- Developers with a C background but unfamiliar with low-level principles
- Learners who want to strengthen their fundamentals and truly understand modern programming language design
- Engineers who want to promote high-quality development and engineering practice in their teams or companies

> This book is not just about Rust syntax. It's about helping you "cultivate both inside and out": learning Rust while also strengthening your computer science foundation, so you can become a true modern systems developer.
